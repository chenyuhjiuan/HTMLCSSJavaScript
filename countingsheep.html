              	<b>Sheep breeds</b><br>
                There are more breeds of sheep than breeds of any other livestock 
                species. Worldwide, there are more than one thousand distinct 
                sheep breeds. There are more than 40 breeds in the United States. 
                Sheep come in all different sizes, shapes, and colors. <br>
                <br>
                There are several different ways to classify sheep breeds: according to their primary purpose 
                (meat, milk, or wool), the type of fibers they grow (fine, medium, 
                long or carpet wool; or hair), the color of their faces (black, 
                white, red, or moddled), and/or by specific physical or production 
                characteristics.<br><br>
                <br>
                <b>Fine wool sheep<br>
                  </b>Fine wool sheep produce wool fibers with a very small fiber 
                  diameter, usually 20 microns or less. Fine wool sheep account for more than 50 percent of the world's sheep population. 
                  Found throughout Australia,, South Africa, South America, and 
                  the Western United States, most sheep of this type belong to the 
                  Merino breed or its derivatives. <br>
                  <br>
                  The Rambouillet, related to the Merino, is the most common breed 
                  of sheep in the U.S., especially the western states where the 
                  majority of sheep in the U.S. can still be found. Fine wool sheep 
                  are best adapted to arid and semi-arid regions. They are known 
                  for their longevity and strong flocking instinct.<br>
                  <br>
                  <br><b>Long wool sheep<br>
                  </b>Long wool sheep produce long-stapled wool with a large fiber 
                    diameter, usually greater than 30 microns. Long wool sheep are 
                    best adapted to cool, high rainfall areas with abundant forage. 
                    They are commonly raised in England, Scotland, New Zealand, and 
                    the Falkland Islands. In the U.S., the fleeces from the long wool 
                    breeds are popular among handspinners.<br>
                  <br><br>
                  <b>Medium wool meat sheep<br>
                  </b>Meat or &quot;mutton-type&quot; sheep produce wool, mostly 
                    medium (or long), but are raised more for their meat qualities. 
                    Medium wool sheep account for about 15 percent of the world's 
                    sheep population. The most popular meat breeds in the U.S. are 
                    Suffolk, Dorset, and Hampshire.<br>
                  <br><br>
                  <b>Carpet wool sheep</b><br>
                  The coarest, lowest grade wool (usually over 38 microns) is used 
                  in the manufacture of carpets. Carpet wool breeds are usually 
                  double-coated, with a coarse long outer coat for protection against 
                  the elements. They are generally adapted to extreme environments. 
                  Carpet wool breeds found in the U.S. include Icelandic, Karakul, 
                  Navajo Churro, and Scottish Blackface.<br>
                  <br><br>
                  <b>Hair Sheep<br>
                  </b>Some breeds lack wool and are covered with hair instead, like 
                    their wild ancestors. Some hair sheep have pure hair coats, whereas 
                    others have coats that contain a mixture of hair and wool fibers 
                    that shed naturally. Hair sheep are found mostly in Africa and 
                    the Caribbean, but are also raised in temperate climates, such 
                    as the U.S. and Canada. <br>
                  <br>
                  Hair sheep account for about 10 percent of the world's sheep population 
                  and are the fastest growing segment of the American sheep industry. 
                  Interest in hair sheep genetics is also developing in Australia, 
                  Europe, and the United Kingdom.<br><br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Fat-tailed sheep<br>
                  </b>Fat tailed or fat-rumped sheep are so-named because they can 
                    store large amounts of fat in the tail and region of the rump. 
                    Fat-tailed sheep are found mostly in the extremely arid regions 
                    of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. They often produce wool, 
                    but are raised primarily for meat or milk production. Fat-tailed 
                    sheep comprise 25 percent of the world's sheep population. The only fat-tailed sheep raised in the U.S. is the Karakul.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b><br>
                  </b><b>Short or rat-tailed breeds<br>
                  </b>Short or rat-tailed breeds originate primarily from Scandinavia 
                    and Northern Europe. Their tails are thin and free of wool and 
                    do not need docked. These breeds tend to be very prolific. Examples 
                    of these breeds include Finn Sheep, Romanov, East Friesian, Shetland, 
                    Icelandic, and Soay.<br>
                  <br>
                  <br><b>Primitive breeds<br>
                  </b>Primitive breeds have developed with minimal human selection 
                    pressure. They typically possess lots of genetic variation between 
                    members, but share characteristics indicative of a breed. A primitive 
                    breed will typically retain survival characteristics that favor 
                    production with minimal human inputs. <br>
                  <br>
                  Consistency among the products produced by the breed is somewhat 
                  lacking, but they are an important source of genetic variation 
                  that may not exist anywhere else. Many primitive breeds live in 
                  isolated mountain regions or on islands. Like some species of 
                  wildlife, many are endangered. Fortunately conservation efforts 
                  are underway to preserve these important genetic resources.<br>
