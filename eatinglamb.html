		<h1>Fresh American Lamb   </h1>
		 
			<p><strong>Nutrient-dense</strong></p>
			<p>Lamb is a prime source of high-quality protein, vitamins, and minerals. As with other red meats, its protein is nutritionally 
                           complete, with all eight essential amino acids in the proper ratios. A 3-ounce serving of lamb provides 43 percent of an adult 
                           male's recommended daily allowance (RDA) of protein. Lamb is high in B vitamins, zinc, and iron. Red meats, especially lamb and 
                           beef, are amongst the best sources of absorbable iron. For those watching their carbohydrate intake, lamb as zero carbs.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Lean and mean</strong></p>
			<p>Compared to other meats, lamb contains very little marbling (fat in the meat). Since lamb fat is on the edges of the meat, 
                           it is easily trimmed off, which means fewer calories, only 175 in an average 3-ounce serving or 7 percent of the average daily 
                           caloric intake recommended for a 23 to 50-year old male. Only about 36 percent of the fat in lamb is saturated fat. The rest is
                           mono or polyunsaturated fat, the "good" fat in one's diet.</p>

			<p><strong>Good fat</strong></p>
			<p>Lamb is one of the richest sources of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). CLA possesses unique and potent antioxidant activity. 
                           It is produced naturally from linoleic acid by bacteria in the stomachs of herbivores (plant eaters), such as sheep, goats, 
                           and cows. CLA cannot be manufactured in the human body. The CLA content in milk and meat is affected by many factors: breed, 
                           age, diet, and management.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Lamb vs. mutton</strong></p>
			<p>The meat from a young sheep (less than 12 months of age) is called lamb. It is naturally tender and mild in flavor. The meat 
                           from an older sheep (over one year of age) is called mutton. It has a more intense flavor than lamb, but is preferred to lamb 
                           in some cultures. Yearling mutton is the meat from a sheep that is between one and two years of age. It is intermediate in 
                           intensity between lamb and mutton.</p>
			<br>
                         
                        <p><strong>Flavor</strong></p>
			<p>There is no flavor difference in the meat from a young intact male and the meat from wethers (castrated male lambs) and ewe lambs
                           As rams sexually mature, their hormones may cause a slight taint in the taste of the meat. Mature rams are more difficult to 
                          harvest than ewes and wethers. In some cultures, the meat from intact males is preferred to the meat from females and castrates.
                          Sometimes, an unblemished lamb is required for slaughter.</p>	
                        <br>
                         <p><strong>The sacrificial lamb</strong></p>
			<p>Since ancient times, lamb has been regarded as a religious symbol. Jesus is often referred to as the "Lamb of "God." Sheep were 
                           commonly used for sacrifice. Lamb was served during the Last Supper. Lamb is traditionally eaten at Easter (especially Orthodox 
                           or Greek) and Passover.</p>	
                        <br>
                        <p>Muslims (followers of Islam) are probably the largest consumers of lamb in the World. Lamb is commonly consumed by Muslims during their
                           major holidays. During Eid al-adha (the Festival of Sacrifice), it is common for Muslim families to sacrifice a lamb in 
                           commemoration of Abraham's sacrifice of a lamb in place of his son. The meat is divided into thirds and shared with family, 
                           friends, and the poor. It is also customary for Muslims to sacrifice lambs to celebrate the birth of a child (two lambs for a 
                           boy child; one for a girl). The sacrifice is part of the "aqiqah" ceremony.</p>
                         <br>			
                         <p><strong>Per capita consumption</strong></p>
			<p>In the U.S., per capita consumption of lamb (and mutton) is very low, less than one pound per person, compared to 57 pounds in 
                           New Zealand. However, many of today's immigrants to the U.S. originate from regions of the world where lamb (and goat) are 
                           commonly consumed. Thus, the U.S. continues to import lamb to meet consumer demand. There is a growing demand for lamb in the 
                           U.S., especially among people of specific ethnic backgrounds.</p>
