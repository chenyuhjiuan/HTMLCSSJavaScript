		<h1>What's for dinner? </h1>
		 
			<p><strong>Grass, clover, and forbs</strong></p>
			<p>Mostly sheep eat grass, clover, forbs, and other pasture plants. They especially love forbs. It is usually their first choice of
                           food in a pasture. A forb is a broad-leaf plant other than grass. It is a flowering plant. Forbs are often very nutritious. As 
                           compared to cattle, sheep eat a greater variety of plants and select a more nutritious diet, but less so than goats.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Grazing time</strong></p>
			<p>Sheep will graze for an average of seven hours per day, mostly in the hours around dawn and in the late afternoon, near sunset. 
                           When supplements are fed, it is best to feed them in the middle of the day so that normal grazing patterns are not disrupted.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Different plants</strong></p>
			<p>Sheep in different geographic areas eat different plants. Tropical forages are usually not as nutritious as those that grow in 
                           temperate climates. Protein is often the most limiting nutrient in forages. All forages are more nutritious if they are eaten in
                           a vegetative state. </p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Pasture (land) requirements</strong></p>
			<p>The amount of pasture or range land that it takes to feed a sheep depends upon the quality of the land (soil), the amount and 
                           distribution of rainfall, and the management of the pasture.</p>
			<br>
                        <p>In dry climates, an acre (or hectare) of pasture or rangeland cannot feed as many sheep as an acre of pasture in a moist climate. 
                           An acre of pasture in the wet season (spring and fall) can support more sheep than an acre in the dry season (usually summer)</p>
			<br>
                        <p>Reproductive rates and lamb growth rates are lower in arid climates than high-rainfall areas that grow more plentiful forage. 
                           As a result, wool production tends to be of greater importance in arid and semi-arid environments, as it takes less nutrition to
                           grow good quality wool than to produce milk and raise lambs. A farmer may be able to graze ten sheep on one acre of improved 
                            pasture in Maryland, whereas one sheep could require ten acres of native range in West Texas.</p>
                        <br> 
                        <p><strong>Stored feed</strong></p>
			<p>When fresh forage is not available, sheep are usually fed stored or harvested feeds: hay, silage, green chop, or crop by-products.
                           Hay is grass that has been mowed (cut) and cured (dried) for use as livestock feed.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Silage (short for ensilage) or haylage is green forage that has been fermented and stored in a silo or other system that keeps 
                           air out. Moldy silage can cause listeriosis in sheep. The pieces should be chopped smaller for sheep as compared to cattle.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Sometimes, pasture plants are cut, chopped, and brought to the sheep. Fresh harvested forage is called green chop. This 
                        "cut-and-carry" system of feeding is common in developing countries, where labor is not a limiting factor.</p>
