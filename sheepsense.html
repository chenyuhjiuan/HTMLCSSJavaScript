		<h1>Sheep Senses </h1>
		<article>
			<p>Because they are a prey animal, sheep require excellent senses to enhance their chances of survival in the wild.</p><br>
			<p><strong>Vision</strong></p>
			<p>Sheep depend heavily on their vision. They have excellent peripheral vision and can see behind themselves without turning 
                           their heads. However, they have poor depth perception. They cannot see immediately in front of their noses. Some vertical 
                           vision may also have been sacrificed in order to have a wider field of vision. For example, it is doubtful that a sheep would 
                           be able to see something in a tree.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Look at their tails</strong></p>
			<p>Sheep have excellent hearing. They can direct their ears in the direction of a sound. Sound arrives at each ear at slightly 
                           different times, with a small difference in amplitude. Sheep are frightened by high-pitched and loud noises, such as barking 
                           dogs or firecrackers.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Smell</strong></p>
			<p>Sheep have an excellent sense of smell. They are very sensitive to what different predators smell like. Smell helps rams locate 
                           ewes in heat and ewes locate their lambs. Sheep also use their sense of smell to locate water and determine subtle or major 
                           differences between feeds and pasture.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Taste</strong></p>
			<p>The sense of taste in sheep is probably not as important as the other senses. However, sheep have the ability to differentiate 
                           different feedstuffs and taste may play a role in this ability. When presented with a variety of feeds, sheep will select certain 
                           feeds over others. Sheep will select different types and species of plants than other livestock.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Touch</strong></p>
			<p>Sheep and goats have many physical differences. Most goats have hair coats that do not require shearing or combing. Most sheep 
			grow wool coats that need to be sheared at least annually. Lamb tails are usually docked (shortened) whereas goat tails are not.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Since the sheep's body is covered with wool or coarse hair, only the nose, lips, mouth, and maybe ears readily lend themselves 
                           to touching behavior. However, touching is important to the interaction between sheep. Lambs seek bodily contact with their 
                           mothers and the ewes respond to touching in many ways, including milk letdown in response to the nuzzling/suckling stimulus of 
                           lambs. When young lambs sleep, they will seek out their mothers and lie close to them.</p>
