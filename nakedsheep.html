              &quot;Naked&quot; sheep</h1>
            <p><strong>History</strong></p>

                </b>The wild ancestors of today's domestic sheep breeds had long, 
                coarse hair and a short, downy undercoat, which under domestication 
                gradually became wool, while the long hair disappeared. Wild sheep, 
                such as the Mouflon, still do not have wooly coats.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
            <p><strong>No Wool</strong></p>

                </b>Some breeds of sheep remain true to their ancestors and do 
                not have long, wooly coats that require shearing. This is because 
                wool is a disadvantage in many environments and not profitable 
                to produce in many circumstances.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
              <p><strong>Found in the tropics</strong></p>

                </b>It is estimated that approximately 10 percent of the world's 
                sheep population is hair sheep, of which an estimated 90 percent 
                are found in Africa and 10 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
               <p><strong>Gaining in popularity</strong></p>
                </b>Hair sheep are increasing rapidly 
                in popularity in the U.S. and other temperate climates because 
                wool is not as profitable as it once was and meat (lamb) is the 
                primary source of income in the majority of sheep operations. 
                Hair sheep are also valued for their production efficiency and 
                &quot;easy-care&quot; nature.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
             <p><strong>Hair vs. wool</strong></p>
                </b>Hair sheep are not a cross between sheep and goats. They have 
                the same number of chromosomes as wooled sheep. The primary difference 
                between hair sheep and wooled sheep is the ratio of hair to wool 
                fibers. All sheep have both types of fibers. Hair sheep have more 
                hair fibers and wool sheep have more wool fibers. Wooled sheep 
                need sheared. Hair sheep do not. Hair sheep also do not usually 
                need their tails docked. Most wooled sheep have their tails docked 
                for reasons of health and sanitation.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
             <p><strong>Differences</strong></p>
                Like wooled breeds, there is considerable difference among 
                hair sheep breeds, depending upon their origins. Some breeds and 
                individuals have short, slick hair coats, absent of wool, while 
                others grow thicker coats that contain a mixture of hair and wool 
                fibers that shed naturally each year. Hair sheep tend to grow 
                more wool fibers in cold climates, thus making them adaptable 
                to different climate extremes.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
             <p><strong>Shedding sheep</strong></p>
                Some of the newer breeds of hair sheep are crosses between 
                &quot;pure&quot; hair sheep breeds and meat-type wooled breeds. 
                They grow more wool than traditional hair sheep, but shed their 
                coats annually and do not require shearing. They may be more accurately 
                identified as &quot;shedding&quot; sheep.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
              <p><strong>Other qualities</strong></p><br>
                Besides shedding their &quot;fleeces,&quot; hair sheep have many 
                other outstanding qualities. Those with tropical origins have 
                a high level of reproduction, are more resistant to internal parasites 
                (worms) than conventional wooled sheep, and have a greater tolerence 
                for heat and humidity.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
             <p><strong>Better leather</strong></p><br>
                From the standpoint of leather, the closer a sheepskin approaches 
                hair sheep, the tighter and firmer the fiber network, and, therefore, 
                the better the skin for producing leather. This is the case because 
                the numerous fine wool fibers, as opposed to the lesser number 
                of coarse fibers of the hair sheep, cause the skin to be more 
                open and loose in texture. <br>
                <br>
                <br>
             <p><strong>Lambs
</strong></p>Hair sheep lambs have excellent vigor. Their growth rates 
                vary according to their breed, genetics, and plane of nutrition. 
                Many of the hair breeds fatten more like goats, depositing fat 
                around their internal organs before laying on external fat. As 
                a result, they should probably not be full-fed in a feed lot. 
                As with goats, it's probably better to grow them more slowly on 
                a lower energy, higher-roughage diet.<br>
